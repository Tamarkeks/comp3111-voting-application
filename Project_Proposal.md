## project description ##

Our application is a platform on android for voting concerning any topic for HKUST students or faculty. Examples such as food, courses, transportation, environment, etc. By including more and more people in this platform, we can collect opinions from others in order to help improve our university experience, and will be able to know how others feel and express our ideas with great unity.

Basically, our platform provides you the following functions:
a. You can view all the voting topics that are going on or have finished.
b. You can vote or motion a topic for voting in this platform.
c. You can give comments regarding the vote you are interested in, stating what you think about this topic, arguing about others’ ideas and so on.
d. You can view your own voting history.

Of course there will be many other functions such as listing the votes according to time of creation or populartity, voting anonymously, etc. But the whole platform is specificly designed for the students and faculty in HKUST to exchange their ideas and to express their feelings.

## Our Motivation ##

In the university where we live, we often have some complaints or opinions about food, lectures, societies, etc. We feel that it’ll be highly beneficial for the univeristy’s community if we create a simple application for others to express their opinions or concerns. The reason we chose to implement this communication platform in the form of a poll is due to the fast and simplistic nature of a poll. We know that some students or staff may not have a lot of time to spend for expressing their concerns/opinions. However, we are aware that some participants may want to express their opinions in more detail; hence, we will also implement a comment section to support these users. We are aware that HKUST have certain methods of collecting data and opinions, but  we haven’t really seen a platform that allows for this type of flexibility and accessibility.



## Development Tools ##
The application will be designed and made by using the following tools:

●    Eclipse 3.7

●    Java SDK

●    Android SDK platform 2.2 (tentative)

●    MySQL database server

●    Subversion




# Project Management Plan #

## Project Development ##
In developing our android application, we are going to use scrum software development process.

## Division of Labor ##
The software will be divided into separate parts and each member is responsible for different parts. Tse Shing Chun, as the interface designer, is in charge of the GUI design. He will draw it, and Xu Mengwei implement it by java programming using packages like swing. Jeremiah is the database developer who in charge of anything concerning database, like set up, configuration, and interface access to mySQL.
Of course there will be lots of cross-work that we do together like testing.

## Communication ##
In every week, at least one meeting will be hold to update each other’s progress. This provides a platform for members to share their difficulties facing on their part and discuss those problems together regularly. Our group might work together in computer laboratory also, having pair programming. This can improve our communication and learn from each other, exchanging ideas.
