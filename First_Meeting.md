<h2> 2.Discussion of issues and proposed solutions </h2>

We encountered an obstacle in managing the user account information file during our database implementation. In our database, the user password is stored plaintext. We feel that it's not viable because of security reasons. Our proposed solution is to encrypt the password from client side before sending it to the database using md5 function in mysql.
